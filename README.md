# Book Finding App
A web app that allows people to enter the characteristics of a book they would like to read. It matches their preferences with books
in the system, and suggests a list of books that they would enjoy. Users are also able to enter books they have enjoyed. If the 
suggestion is not in the library system, it will be added.

## Usage
Follow these steps to use the app:
1.  Fork the repo
2.  Create a new database to store book data
3.  Configure the database in app.js
4.  Copy the filepath of information into match.js
